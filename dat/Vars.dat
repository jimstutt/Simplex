According to provisional figures for 2015 in the UK government CCC's fifth carbon budget (2015) show that UK emissions are 38% below 1990 levels. 

The UK government has committed to reduce UK emissions by 57% by 2030.

The UK has a legal requirement under the 2008 Climate Chgange Act is to reduce emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels.

This gives an emissions limit of 1,765 MtCO2e over the period 2028-2032 including emissions from international shipping. This is an emissions reduction of 57% on 1990 levels. 

If international shipping emissions were excluded then an emission limit of 1,725 MtCO2e would be appropriate over the period 2028-2032.

A new domestic energy efficiency supplier obligation will run for 5 years. 

"The new scheme will upgrade the energy efficiency of over 200,000 homes per year, saving those homes up to £300 off their annual energy bill".

Q. How many UK homes could be insulated?
Q. How many domestic boilers could be replaced?

Maximise carbon reduction per £.
